    \textbf{What is this?}

    Since there are a few hits of people who download these files directly from
    a Google results page, instead of from my website, I add here a small
    explanation:

    These files contain derivations which I often use and, before I wrote them
    down cleanly, would often make small mistakes on (like leaving off a minus
    sign or such). They are also automatically checked with \textbf{sage}, so
    that the computer assures that there were no mis-steps in the derivation.

    This is also why you see code in the derivation instead of just the
    equations. This is run by \textbf{sage}.
